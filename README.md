## :star2: About the Project
The system utilizes `loadstring` to dynamically fetch and execute scripts from our GitHub repository. This method enables us to pull in the latest code updates directly into our Roblox projects.

When a change is detected, the system automatically updates the live script to the new version. This ensures that any new features, bug fixes, or improvements are instantly applied to the Roblox game or experience without rebooting servers.
